There a lot of studies showing the correlation between GDP by country and average life satisfcation. Usually, most countries with higher GDP tend to have higher average life satisfaction scores.
Inspired by this findings, I began to wonder.. 'What other aspects of life significantly contribute to happiness?'
Specifically, I wanted to explore which quality of life indicators have a significant relationship with the happiness scores of different regions. 

Research Question : **Which quality of life indicators have a significant relationship with the happiness score among different regions?**
